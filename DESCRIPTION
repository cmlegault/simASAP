Description: Starting with a successfully run ASAP data file, conduct self-test 
  by generating data with measurement errors that follow the prescribed distribution 
  type and level of uncertainty. Can optionally run ASAP on each created data set. 
  Can plot Freport, recruitment, and spawning stock biomass time series estimates from
  each simulated data set and compare to true values.
